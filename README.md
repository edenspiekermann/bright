easy brightcove abstraction

## About

This abstraction wraps the Brightcove video player API with the official HTML5 Media and Media Events API. It does not have a complete feature parity, due to the lack of some features Brightcove doesnâ€™t provide. An example of the HTML5 Media API can be found [http://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html](here).
