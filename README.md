# Bright

easy brightcove abstraction for IE8+

## About

This abstraction wraps the Brightcove video player API with the official HTML5 Media and Media Events API. It does not have a complete feature parity, due to the lack of some features Brightcove doesnâ€™t provide. An example of the HTML5 Media API can be found [http://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html](here).

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` to watch for file changes in `src/videoplayer.js`
4. make changes
5. `npm test` starts a local webserver and opens your default browser `http://localhost:8000/tests`
6. `npm run build` if all your tests pass
7. push to `develop`, merge into `master`
